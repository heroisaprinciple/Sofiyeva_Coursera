I am Arina Sofiyeva. 
This is a week one assignment for "Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments"
by University of Colorado Boulder.

This is a simple programming assignment that prints statistics to the command line using a variety of c-programming operators and features.

To compile and run the project, use ``gcc -o stats.out stats.c`` and ``./stats.out``.
